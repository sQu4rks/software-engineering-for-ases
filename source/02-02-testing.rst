Testing Software 
================

Testing software has become a crucial aspect in every development process. While 
software testing used to be carried out by a Quality Assurance department after the 
development was finished most modern software is tested while being developed. 

**Testing**
    In software development testing is the process of varifying that a application meets a certain standard or functionality and quality. In testing we differentiate the types of visibility into the inner workings of the software with white-box, black-box and hybrid testing as well as the level of testing with unit testing, integration testing and system testing.
