Software Engineering for SE
===========================

In this course we will cover the basics of Software Engineering. Software Engineering, as a engineering 
discipline is a relatively young subject and also part art and part science. 

The goal of this course is to get you acquainted with the basic cycle used in Software Engineering as well
as the tools commonly used to deploy software in todays rapidly changing world.

As this is a two-day course the topics are split among these days and augmented with labs. 

Day one will cover

* Software Lifecycle and Software development Lifecycle
* Requirements Engineering
* Software Architecture and UML
* Software Design Patterns

On day two we will then jump into 

* Test-Driven Development 
* Unit Testing
* Scenario Testing
* Software Deployment
* DevOps
* Version Control
* Continous Integration 
* Documenting Software
